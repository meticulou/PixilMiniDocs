### The Vision: A Persistent, Player-Driven Simulation

Pixil Mini envisions a blockchain RPG where the world thrives as a player-shaped tapestry, free from developer-imposed limits. Inspired by the emergent autonomy of games like Ultima VI—where NPCs lived their lives and players could bend the rules—the project harnesses blockchain to craft an infinite, persistent environment without traditional servers. This liberates solo developers like Louie from hosting costs and anti-cheat burdens, enabling an MMO-scale adventure that’s accessible and equitable.

The game's "freedomjank" ethos celebrates unscripted moments: minis interacting in quirky ways, player-built dungeons yielding surprises, or spontaneous trades in bustling AREAs. Blockchain serves as the immutable foundation, ensuring state changes and enabling cross-project utility—elevating NFTs from collectibles to active game components.

Exploration drives the experience. The world unfolds as an infinite grid of interconnected AREAs, where squads roam and interact. Persistence is key: Enter an AREA, and you might glimpse other players' squads, sparking trades or collaborations by chance. Traveling between AREAs triggers battles with monsters socketed by the target area's owner, updating your position on-chain, while local movements and roaming occur client-side for fluidity. This cycle—travel, battle, explore—fosters a sense of discovery, with the world expanding through community engagement, crafting a legacy that endures beyond individual sessions.

By focusing on simulation over speculation, Pixil Mini targets players who crave depth, aiming to revive the golden age of RPGs while showcasing blockchain’s potential to empower creators and players alike.

### Core Mechanics: Minis, AREAs, and Interactions

Pixil Mini's gameplay revolves around minis, AREAs, and a travel-battle-explore loop, blending ownership with simulation for a rich experience.

**Minis: Customizable NFT Heroes**  
Minis are the soul of the game—randomized NFT characters featuring six stats (Strength, Agility, Endurance, Wisdom, Intuition, Spirit) totaling 15-42 points, plus two aspects (e.g., Fire, Shadow) that shape skills and affinities. With a 20% chance for max stats and 10% for rare skin tones, each mini stands out.

Modularity drives variety: Parts like hair, eyes, and clothing layer across slots, with three color tiers (primary, secondary, tertiary) for materials like gold zippers. A hierarchical randomizer ensures coherent designs, yielding decillions of combinations. Upgrades unlock animations (9-100+ frames by rarity), glow effects, and backgrounds, enhancing their visual and tactical appeal.

Players form squads, equipping minis with item NFTs for stat boosts. Spine2D rigging powers movements like roaming and attacking, making minis feel alive in AREAs.

**AREAs: The Infinite World Grid**  
The world is an infinite grid of AREAs—NFT tilemaps initially crafted by mappers employed by Flying Bastion. These connect cardinally, forming a sprawling landscape with wild zones for monster encounters and public areas as safe hubs. The grid’s flexibility allows for organic growth, with each AREA a canvas for exploration and interaction.

Persistence enhances immersion: Squads occupy AREAs on-chain, visible to others in the same space. Chance encounters add excitement—stumble upon another squad, and you might trade gear or collaborate. Traveling between AREAs triggers battles with monsters socketed by the owner, updating your location via smart contracts, while client-side roaming within AREAs keeps the action fluid.

**Game Loop: Travel, Battle, Explore**  
The core loop defines gameplay: Travel to a new AREA, face a battle with the owner’s socketed monsters in turn-based JRPG-style combat, then explore to harvest resources, trade, change gear, eat food, or buff up before the next journey. No PvP ensures a cooperative focus, with monster challenges testing squad strategies. Persistence ties it together—your squad’s state, including equipped items and harvested goods, carries across sessions.

### NFT Socketing: Reviving Player Creativity and Utility

A standout innovation, NFT socketing allows players to integrate third-party NFTs into Pixil Mini as functional elements—billboards, frames, or portraits—addressing a decades-old industry challenge: the loss of user-generated content due to copyright disputes.

In games like Counter-Strike, players once sprayed custom tags on maps, fostering creativity until lawsuits forced developers to limit uploads to in-house art. Pixil Mini reverses this with blockchain: Socketed NFTs are owned originals, not copies, ensuring artists receive royalties and recognition. For instance, an AREA owner sockets a WAX artist’s NFT as a billboard, boosting its visibility and value in-game.

This system extends utility to any WAX collection, turning Pixil Mini into a collaborative hub. Artists gain exposure, projects thrive through integration, and players personalize without legal risks. By solving the "custom spray" problem—where unauthorized uploads hurt creators—NFT socketing empowers the ecosystem, making Pixil Mini a pioneer in bridging Web3 creativity with fair compensation.

### NPC Vendors: A Spatially Ordered Marketplace

Pixil Mini introduces NPC vendors as a unique, on-chain marketplace, where AREA owners socket minis as shopkeepers, lore-tellers, or blacksmiths. This creates a physical, browsable economy reminiscent of a Blockbuster store, contrasting with abstract search-filter systems.

Owners stock inventories with any NFTs—Pixil Mini items or from other WAX collections—setting prices and buyback rates based on materials. Visitors explore spatially: Walk an AREA, inspect shelves, and transact securely on-chain. Limited "shelf space" adds strategy—prime spots for high-demand items drive competition.

Blacksmith NPCs offer crafting services, merging materials into new NFTs, while lore NPCs enrich narratives. Fees could reward owners, creating a sustainable loop. This system enhances NFT utility, offering players a tactile shopping experience and a revenue stream for AREA holders.

### Dungeons: Player-Crafted Challenges and Rewards

Dungeons elevate Pixil Mini by empowering AREA owners as "dungeon masters," designing instanced challenges within their spaces. Owners socket monster NFTs as foes, set loot tables with drop odds, and define entrance fees—displayed on an entry plaque for transparency.

Combat unfolds in turn-based JRPG style, testing squad stats and aspects against waves. Loot pools include Pixil Mini items or any WAX NFTs, crafting diverse reward ecosystems. Success yields prizes; failure invites retries, adding replayability.

This feature taps into the joy of dungeon mastery: Theme lairs around aspects (e.g., a Shadow crypt), balance difficulty, and earn from fees. The community gains varied content, while owners profit from traffic, turning exploration into thrilling adventures.

---

### Bases and Internal Structures: Layered World Depth

Pixil Mini introduces bases—instanced node-trees inside AREAs—adding verticality to the infinite grid. Beyond four cardinal exits (North, East, South, West), AREAs support up to four additional portals (e.g., cave entrances, stairs), leading to internal layers.

These "inside" spaces connect cardinally, forming rooms or complexes—like a house or dungeon—stacking multiple layers tied to the origin AREA. The data structure, a doubly linked list with cardinal rules as guidelines (not rigid code), allows flexible designs. Non-cardinal exits (exit1-exit4) enable custom paths, with the client rendering only NESW for map clarity.

**Building NFTs**: Socketable into random building sockets on AREAs, these NFTs (found as items or crafted by builder NPCs) have doors to internal bases. Stats limit internal area counts, with RNG determining size and features—custom homes for crews enhance personalization.

---

### World Expansion: Exploring to Reveal New Horizons

Pixil Mini’s world grows through exploration, echoing artPG’s expansive vision with a feasible on-chain approach. Rather than players crafting AREAs directly, a randomizer—potentially powered by a smart contract querying an oracle—generates new AREAs. This oracle could send immutable property lists (tilemaps, sprite references), which the contract mints as NFTs, ensuring rule enforcement (e.g., wild vs. public zones).

Players "discover" these areas by traveling, revealing new landscapes with potential resource nodes, optimal layouts, building sockets, NPC slots, and higher-tier resources. This simplifies expansion, avoiding the complexity of player-edited maps, and guarantees balance—wild areas always connect, public ones can dead-end as towns.

Exploration drives the narrative: Uncover a resource-rich jungle or a socket-ready plateau, sparking squad builds or vendor setups. The travel-battle-explore loop integrates this growth, with new areas offering fresh challenges and opportunities, enhancing the game’s infinite scope.

### Blockchain Integration: Seamless Persistence and Agency

Pixil Mini harnesses WAX's 0.5-second blocks, zero fees, and EOSIO contracts to deliver a serverless world. Smart contracts collaborate with the Unity client: The app manages client-side roaming and rendering, while contracts validate and record actions like travel or chat, ensuring immutability.

This synergy uses event sourcing to maintain a tamper-proof state, with clients querying tables for real-time data—e.g., co-located squads. Contracts could support travel, item management, area generation, or other features, offering a flexible framework for future growth. AtomicAssets powers NFT minting and trading, with bridges to BASE and ETH expanding reach.

The result is a trustless ecosystem where ownership drives gameplay—socketing NFTs, running vendors—all without centralized servers, optimized for solo development and community expansion.

### Technical Architecture: Tools for Creation and Play

Pixil Mini's tech stack balances creator efficiency with player performance.

**Generator Tool**: Built in Godot, it’s being upgraded with Spine2D rigging alongside its existing system. The randomizer rolls minis, applies colors/parts, and exports animated GIFs with glows and backgrounds. JSON files capture properties for NFT minting, with rarity influencing features.

**Map Editor and Viewer**: Mappers use Tiled to craft AREAs, exporting embedded data. Unity's viewer renders tilemaps, loading sprites from banks for seamless display.

**Client (Unity)**: Via WAX SDK, it logs in, fetches squads/AREAs, and uses Spine2D pools for minis. Client-side logic includes collisions and pathfinding on tilegrids.

Security focuses on audits, with scalability via WAX's efficiency. Future optimizations ensure smooth mobile/web play.
